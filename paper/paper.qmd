# Introduction

"In case of an emergency, please call 911." From building walls to road signs, this is a message that appears almost everywhere, and it instills the idea that no matter the circumstance, there will always be emergency services available to help. However, research shows that this is not the case. A report on Toronto's paramedic services highlights that there were no ambulances available to over 1,000 calls in 2023 [@auditorreport]. With drastically increasing wait times for those who required Emergency Medical Services (EMS), it is crucial to understand why paramedic services are unable to keep up with a seemingly growing demand for EMS.

In response to this rising challenge, the report posits that in order to elevate the "efficiency and effectiveness" [@auditorreport] of Toronto's paramedic services, further research on how to manage EMS demand is needed. Thus, this paper seeks to investigate the factors that seem to be driving EMS demand. Using Paramedic Services Incident Data offered by Toronto Paramedic Services, the aim is to identify which types of emergencies (e.g. medical emergencies or vehicle accidents) drive EMS demand and examine whether . Knowing this can help inform effective strategies that allocate resources to these drivers for better EMS demand management. 

With this, this analysis first examines the total number of emergency calls made from 2017 to 2022 to better understand how EMS demand has changed over time. Then, it looks at EMS demand through five different incident types as outlined by Toronto Paramedic Services to identify the incident types that push EMS demand. Lastly, this analysis considers whether drivers of EMS demand differ between different regions. As a result, the present analysis finds that overall, medical emergencies, incidents requiring emergency transfers, and vehicle accidents seem to be the most prominent drivers of EMS demand. However, as different drivers of EMS demand are found for different regions, this analysis highlights that while strategies that target medical emergencies, incidents requiring emergency transfers, and vehicle accidents may enhance the overall efficiency of paramedic services, it is also crucial to consider the unique needs of various regions and their residents to shape stronger EMS-demand-management strategies.

In what follows, a description of the data that was used within this analysis (@sec-data), detailed account of the results (@sec-results), and a brief discussion of the analysis along with its limitations and next steps (@sec-discussion) will be provided. 

# Data {#sec-data}

## Toronto Paramedic Services Data

Paramedic Services Incident Data (2017-2022) is provided by Toronto Paramedic Services [@torontoparamedicservices]. The records of when a paramedic was dispatched having received a call, they type of incident, the priority level of each incident, the number of paramedic units that arrived at the scene, and the general location of each incident are all updated by hand to the city of Toronto's Open Data portal [@opentorontodata]. 

To simulate, test, download, and clean the Paramedic Services Incident Data (2017-2022), the statistical programming language R was used [@citeR]. Specific libraries that assisted the analysis include `tidyverse` [@tidyverse], `dplyr` [@dplyr], `opendatatoronto` [@opendatatoronto], `tinytex` [@tinytex], `ggplot2` [@ggplot2], `knitr` [@knitr], `maps` [@maps], and `sf` [@sf]. 

The Paramedic Services Incident Data is refreshed annually and contains information on every single incident paramedics have responded to since January 1st to December 31st in 2017 to 2022. For every day of each year, there are multiple records of incidents that have occurred. For every record, there is an ID number, the date and time when a paramedic unit was dispatched, the type of incident, the severity of the incident (priority), the number of paramedic units at the scene, and the general location of the incident. @tbl-rawdata below previews this information for recorded incidents in 2022.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| label: tbl-rawdata
#| tbl-cap: "Paramedic Services Incident Data for 2022" 

data <- read_csv(here::here("data/raw_data/raw_data_2022.csv"))

data <- 
 data |> 
  select(-...1)

data |>
  slice(1:3) |>
  kable(
    col.names = c("ID", "Dispatch Time", "Incident Type", "Priority", 
                  "Units Arrived", "Location"),
    digits = 1,
    booktabs = TRUE,
    linesep = "",
    align = c("l", "l", "l", "l", "l", "l"),
    format.args = list(big.mark = ",")
  )

```

Looking at @tbl-rawdata, the variable, "ID", is a number that identifies each incident in accordance with a Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) record [@torontoparamedicservices]. "Dispatch Time" represents the date and time, measured in minutes and seconds, at which paramedics responded to an emergency call. This data further provides information on the type of emergency paramedics responded to with the variable, "Incident Type". "Priority" refers to the urgency of all incoming emergency calls. The priority level is measured using a "Medical Priority Dispatch System (MPDS)" that organizes incoming information from 911 callers into different categories. For instance, in @tbl-rawdata, the priority level is 1 for all three incidents, meaning that the MPDS assessed the information provided by callers and their situations as extremely urgent. "Units Arrived" is a count of the number of paramedic units that were present at the scene. Lastly, "Location" characterizes the approximate location of each incident and is measured using Forward Sortation Areas (i.e. the first three characters of postal codes). 

## Analysis Data {#sec-analysis}

For this analysis, the variables of interest are the different types of incidents that are recorded. The Paramedic Services Incident Data lists five different incident types: (1) medical emergencies, (2) motor vehicle accidents, (3) emergency transfers, (4) fires, and (5) airport standbys. Each type refers to a different circumstance under which individuals may call 911 for EMS. 

As the objective is to understand the driving factors of EMS demand, the actual data that is used within this analysis reflects the total EMS demand and the demand for each incident type over the course of six years (2017-2022). All recorded incidents were aggregated together by incident type to see the number of emergency calls for each type. Then, the number of emergency calls for each incident type were summed to produce a total EMS demand count. This process was repeated every year from 2017 to 2022. @tbl-analysis (found below) illustrates the outcome of this process, and summary statistics for this analysis data can be found in the Appendix (@sec-appendix).

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| label: tbl-analysis
#| tbl-cap: "Organized Paramedic Services Incident Data (2017-2022)"

data <- read_csv(here::here("data/analysis_data/analysis_data.csv"))

data |>
  slice(1:6) |>
  kable(
    col.names = c("Year", "Medical Calls", "Vehicle Accident Calls", "Emergency Transfer Calls",
                  "Fire Calls", "Airport Standby Calls", "Unclassified Calls", "Total Emergency Calls"),
    digits = 1,
    booktabs = TRUE,
    linesep = "",
    align = c("l", "l", "l", "l", "l", "l")
  )
```


The column "Unclassified Calls" in @tbl-analysis represents the emergency calls that were not assigned an incident type. It is important to note that throughout the analysis, these records are omitted. 

## Map Data

To further understand what drives EMS demand, this analysis uses the Forward Sortation Areas (FSA) provided by the Paramedic Services Incident Data (2017-2022) to map EMS demand across all the locations Toronto Paramedic Services respond to. The map is based on the Paramedic Services Incident Data from 2022. By grouping the data shown in @sec-analysis by FSAs, the types of incidents recorded within each unique FSA and the number of incidents that occurred with each incident type could be found. The "driver" of EMS demand for a given FSA was determined by the incident type that had the most number of calls. A small snippet of the modified analysis data is shown below in @tbl-mapdata. The column, "CFSAUID" contains every FSA that Toronto Paramedic Services responded to in 2022. 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| label: tbl-mapdata
#| tbl-cap: "Modified Analysis Data for Mapping" 

data <- read_csv(here::here("data/analysis_data/analysis_data_FOR_MAP.csv"))

data |>
  slice(1:2) |>
  kable(
    col.names = c("CFSAUID", "Incident Type", "Emergency Transfers", "Medical Emergencies",
                  "Vehicle Accidents", "Fires", "Airport Standbys", "EMS Demand Driver"),
    digits = 1,
    booktabs = TRUE,
    linesep = "",
    align = c("r", "r", "r", "r", "c", "r"),
    format.args = list(big.mark = ",")
  )
```

To map this data, a shapefile with the spatial information for all recorded FSAs is combined with the data shown in @tbl-mapdata. The shapefile, titled, "2021 Census - Boundary Files", is provided by the Open Government Data portal from the Government of Canada [@2021census]. Additional information about this dataset, including how it is used can be found in the Appendix (@sec-appendix).

```

@fig-totalemsdemand displays the total number of emergency calls for each year. The total number of emergency calls appears to increase in 2020 after a notable decrease in 2019. This pattern likely reflects the the onset of the covid-19 pandemic. Though the number of emergency calls appears to fluctuate over the years, the change is not drastic, indicating that there has consistently been a heightened demand for EMS.

## EMS Demand from 2017 to 2022 Based on Incident Type

To further unpack what is driving this consistent demand, the calls for individual incident type are also considered. @fig-incidentemsdemand illustrates the number of emergency calls for each incident type along with the total number of emergency calls. Based on @fig-incidentemsdemand, demands for EMS are markedly higher for medical emergencies than any other incident type, suggesting that medical circumstances are key drivers that propel EMS demand.

```


By zooming into @fig-incidentemsdemand with @fig-incidentemsdemandzoom below, a clearer look at the other incident types is provided. With @fig-incidentemsdemandzoom, it becomes clear that vehicle accidents and emergency transfers may be other potential drivers of EMS demand, though not as strong as medical emergencies.

\newpage

As medical emergencies seem to be prominent drivers of EMS demand, strategies that focus on efficiently managing calls for medical emergencies may help to better navigate EMS demand as a whole. Response times for EMS demand have been greatly impacted by offload delays, staffing/training challenges, and traffic congestion [@auditorreport]. With medical emergencies, a shortage of doctors has placed pressure on paramedic services as residents rely on and turn to these services more often [@cbcarticle]. This in turn, increases in offload delays - the time it takes to offload patients into hospitals. Longer offload delays mean longer response times for other incidents. Putting all of this together, a strategy to better manage EMS demand for medical emergencies may be to focus on promoting primary-care providers (i.e. family doctors) and to allocate resources to provide additional health services (e.g. programs to consult with a health-care professional online from home).

Similarly, as vehicle accidents and emergency transfers can be potential drivers of EMS demand, overall EMS demand may be better managed if paramedic service strategies also target vehicle-accident- and emergency-transfer-related calls. Traffic congestion has been found to increase paramedic response times [@journal], and with the current increase in traffic due to multiple construction projects throughout Toronto, longer paramedic response times and the unavailability of paramedic services can be expected. To efficiently navigate EMS demand for vehicle accidents and emergency transfers, strategies may center around vehicle accident prevention or the allocation of more staff and resources to accident or emergency-prone regions for faster response times. 

## Mapping EMS Demand 

By examining EMS demand through different incident types, the investigation above finds that medical emergencies are responsible for a significantly large portion of 911 calls. However, this finding is a generalization of all the forward sortation areas that Toronto Paramedic Services responded to over several years. Medical emergencies may not be the driver of EMS demand for all regions or communities. Thus, the following part of this analysis looks to identify the driver for every unique forward sortation area Toronto Paramedic Services responded to in 2022. If different forward sortation areas have different drivers of EMS demand, then strategies that are tailored to each region's circumstance may be more effective in managing overall EMS demand. 

@fig-map illustrates the individual drivers of EMS demand for all forward sortation areas. From this illustration, clear differences in what propels EMS demand can be observed. For instance, in the larger forward sortation areas that surround the city of Toronto, incidents that require emergency transfers appear to be factors that raise EMS demand.

\newpage

By focusing in on the city of Toronto with @fig-mapzoom, EMS demand seems to be significantly driven by medical emergencies and slightly driven by vehicle accidents and emergency transfers.  

These results suggest that what drives EMS demand is dependent on the characteristics of a particular region. Socio-economic or demographic factors such as income or population density of a given area can impact the types of incidents that occur, total number of emergency calls that are made and the severity of each incident. Thus, there is a need to consider individual communities to build tailored solutions that effectively address their unique needs and better manage widespread EMS demand.

# Discussion {#sec-discussion}

## Summary

As high demand for EMS continues to be a challenge, identifying the areas where most of the demand comes from can help to inform effective demand-management strategies. Through an investigation of EMS demand, the present analysis identifies three main drivers of EMS demand (medical emergencies, incidents requiring emergency transfers, and vehicle accidents) and also considers how these drivers might differ in different contexts (i.e. different regions or communities).

To further this research, the relationship between the driver of EMS demand for every forward sortation area and each area's socio-economic or demographic characteristics should be examined. As there are many variables that can impact one's health and ultimately, whether or not they have to seek EMS, understanding how factors like income or population density affect the occurrence of medical emergencies, emergency transfers, and vehicle accidents can help build tailored and effective strategies. It may also be helpful to consider ambulance station locations in addition to @fig-map to see whether ambulance stations and resources are optimally distributed and if additional resources are needed depending on the EMS demand driver for a particular region. 

In short, the findings of this analysis offer a deeper understanding about what drives EMS demand, and this understanding can further facilitate the exploration of various strategies that allow paramedic services to effectively operate even under high demand.

## Limitations

Though this analysis carefully examines EMS demand, there are some limitations to consider. It is mentioned in @sec-analysis that the records of incidents without an assigned incident type were omitted from the analysis. However, this may have limited the overall representation of each incident type as well as the conclusions that are made. Further, it is important to note that @fig-map only data from 2022. So, although @fig-map demonstrates that differences between regions and their drivers for EMS demand can exist, it is not an accurate reflection of what each forward sortation area because only one instance (the year 2022) is considered.

The shapefile that is used in this analysis contains the forward sortation area boundaries for every province and territory of Canada. In this file, every forward sortation area is matched with a set of spatial information (i.e. coordinates). @tbl-shape illustrates this data. "CFSAUID" contains every FSA that Toronto Paramedic Services responded to in 2022, and "DGUID" refers to the "Dissemination Geography Unique Identifier (DGUID)" - an ID that all geographic areas in Canada have. The variables, "PRUID" and "PRNAME", represent province numbers and names, respectively. "LANDAREA" is the total area in square kilometers of each forward sortation area, and "Geometry" holds the spatial information for every area.

To isolate the forward sortation areas given in the Paramedic Services Incident Data for 2022, ArcGIS Pro software [@arcgis] was used to remove any areas that were not recorded. Specifically, the forward sortation areas that were not present within the Paramedic Services Incident Data were deleted from the shapefile's attribute table (i.e. data table) and re-saved as a new shapefile. After making the necessary modifications, the spatial data for forward sortation areas was merged with the data present in @tbl-mapdata and mapped to show the "EMS Demand Driver" for every area. The final map is shown in @fig-map.
